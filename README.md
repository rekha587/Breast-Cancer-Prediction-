# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-


Breast cancer is a dominant cancer in women worldwide and is increasing in developing countries where the majority of cases are diagnosed in late stages. The project we are proposed show a comparison of machine learning algorithms with the help of different techniques. 
This project presents a comparison of seven machine learning (ML) algorithms: Random Forest (RT), Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.
For the implementation of the ML algorithms, the dataset was partitioned into the training phase and the testing phase. 


## Machine Learning Techniques Used:
1. SVM (support vector machine)
2. Random Forest classifier
3. KNN
4. C5 â€“ Decision Tree
5. C-Tree
6. Neural Network model
7. Logistic Regression
